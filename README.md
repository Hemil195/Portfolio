# Portfolio Project

This is a full-stack portfolio website project built with React.js for the frontend and Node.js/Express.js for the backend.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:
- `client/` - Frontend React application
- `server/` - Backend Node.js/Express.js server

## Frontend (Client)

The frontend is built using React.js with the following key features and dependencies:
- React Router for navigation
- FontAwesome for icons
- React Toastify for notifications
- React TSParticles for particle effects
- React Type Animation for typing animations
- AOS (Animate On Scroll) for scroll animations

### Getting Started with Frontend

1. Navigate to the client directory:
```bash
cd client
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

## Backend (Server)

The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js with the following features:
- MongoDB database integration using Mongoose
- RESTful API endpoints
- CORS enabled
- Nodemailer for email functionality
- Input validation using validator

### Getting Started with Backend

1. Navigate to the server directory:
```bash
cd server
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the server directory with necessary environment variables

4. Start the server:
```bash
node app.js
```

The backend server will run on `http://localhost:6002`
